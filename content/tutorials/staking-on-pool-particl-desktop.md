## Set-up pool staking

1. Open Particl Desktop
1. On Overview page, click on `+` button in Cold-staking widget
1. Paste the **Pool Address** of your staking pool of choice
1. Click `Enable cold staking` button to confirm

> For staking on our [Particl.page Pool](https://pool.particl.page), you would simply enter `pcs1vzuadmp42slqapdm8eevm6g8ntm3hlvgptmyjy`

Almost stupidly simple, right? And that’s the point.


### What happens next?

With this setup, each time bunch of your coins stake, they will get “moved” to the Pool. This is the best way to transition to staking on a Pool.

This is, however, not ideal when you have little amounts of coins, as it would take ages for them to stake by themselves. For these cases, there’s “zapping”.


## Zapping coins for instant cold-staking

With cold-staking activated, you can “zap” your coins and move them instantly to staking pool.

While it is certainly useful for smaller amounts of coins (<1,000), keep it mind that “zapping” sends all your coins to the pool in 1 transaction (not ideal from privacy point of view).
