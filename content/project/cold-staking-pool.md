> Particl Staking pool with low fees and fair reward distribution

We're operating our community staking pool at [pool.particl.page](https://pool.particl.page) since 2018.

Commited to no-BS approach, pool fees are set at 2.5% to cover the hosting costs.

Staking rewards are fairly split between all stakers based on amount of their staking coins (so no extra rewards for stakers who actually find a block).
