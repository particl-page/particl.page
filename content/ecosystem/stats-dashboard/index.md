> Tracking Particl stats in style, all-in-one

[Stats.particl.page](https://stats.particl.page) &ndash; our first ever project for Particl.

Particl Stats was created as a place for centralized (oh, the irony) place for various statistics related to Particl network.

Built for tracking and displaying all the interesting statistics about Particl, its coin and blockchain.

More stats & features are planned further down the road. If you have tips for stats you'd like to see, [get in touch with us](/about).
