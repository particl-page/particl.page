Unlike many other swapping platforms out there, [WizardSwap](https://www.wizardswap.io) does not interact with any exchange order books so orders have no influence on any exchange prices. Instead it draws liquidity directly from [localparticl.com](https://www.localparticl.com) users who have deposited funds and opted to enable swaps. Pricing is based on a global average plus the margins liquidity providers have set.
