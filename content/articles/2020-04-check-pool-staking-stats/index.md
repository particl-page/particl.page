We’ve recently launched pool staking statistics for individual addresses on [our Pool](https://pool.particl.page). To check your stats, you’ll need to know your pool staking address.


## Checking pool staking address

After you join a staking pool, all you need to do is to wait for it to find at least one block. Your wallet will show a new “Staked” transaction (with 0 value). Copy address in this transaction and enter it on the [homepage of our Pool](https://pool.particl.page) to check it’s stats.

> In both cases, pool staking address in this particular wallet is `2wN2i3wP1D8YagrwazD4mRL3LiQVMfK6BMm6GhZh8t6mLwotHPN`


## Checking staking stats on Pool

Now that we know our staking address, we can paste it to [Particl.page Pool](https://pool.particl.page):
