Welcome back to our bite-sized series about core features of #private crypto [Particl Project](https://particl.io)!

> Missed the first article? See [Particl Basics #1: The privacy coin]({{< ref "articles/2020-04-particl-basics-01-privacy-coin.md" >}}) to get up to speed.

We're already familiar with Particl's privacy coin, so let's see how it can work for you – it's time to get into staking.


## Proof-of-Stake v3

Particl is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain (as opposed to Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work), so new coins are generated via "staking" process.

> **Never heard about PoS?** [Proof-of-Stake by Simply Explained (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3EFi_POhps) is a nice starting resource.

Particl, as a relatively small blockchain[^1], is ideal for PoS, as it makes it more secure[^2], fair and also green.


## Inflation vs Coin supply

Let's look at the core attributes first. Particl's current **inflation sits at 3% per year** and that will drop to 2% this July. That's effectively much higher, than what you can get in any local bank. However it's not high enough to excessively bloat the whole cryptocurrency supply.

> Interesting fact: **Particl's coin supply is very rare** (~ [9,600,000 PART](https://explorer.particl.io/status) at the time of writing), so at 2%, it would take 39 years to get to Bitcoin's coin supply (= 21M coins in the year 2059)!

Keep in mind that all these newly generated coins go to the pockets of its users – the stakers. However, not everybody stakes (e.g. active traders). Still, [the amount of total staking coins](https://stats.particl.page) is consistently _at least_ above 50%. And since the staking rewards are calculated not based on total supply, but on actual staking coins, the rewards for stakers are even higher[^3].


## Staying financially in control

> Keep the 3rd parties at the door. Your keys, your crypto.

Staking on Particl is completely non-custodial. You have surely heard the phrase _"not your keys, not your crypto"_. Now add to that also _"no delegates and no masternodes"_.

Well, staking PART, you retain all your keys, coins and possibly even the hardware in your hands and under your roof.

The control goes even further. You decide _[how to stake](https://particl.wiki/tutorial/staking/)_. Use your phone, your computer, your hardware wallet (!) or even set up a dedicated staking device using Raspberri Pi and an [easy-to-use utility](https://particl.wiki/learn/staking/partyman) to set up everything automatically!


## Key takeaways

Staking is at the core of keeping Particl secure. Rewards are distributed to active holders for doing their part (no pun intended.. _or was it?_). Nothing is forced – you retain your control and decide which way to stake™.

And all this is purely an underlying mechanism for the decentralized apps to work on top of Particl. Yes, you guessed it – those will come in future articles.

See you until then!
